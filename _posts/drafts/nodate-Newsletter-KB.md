Dear all,

after some time of apparent silence from our side we would like to update you a little bit on the activities in the HSF during this period.

We have many efforts going on in parallel. Not quite at the speed we were hoping fore when we started, but nevertheless there is tangible progress. In the next few newsletters we would like to update you on the following topics:

   * Finding and advertising existing SW - the HSF knowledge base
   * WikiToLearn - A place for training and teaching
   * The HSF Packaging Working Group - how to build and distribute SW
   * Starting your own SW project - hands-on support by the community
   * Sharing ideas and code - technical notes and SW licenses

Today's newsletter will be dedicated to the new HSF Knowledge Base. But before we come to that, a little reminder of our [HSF website](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), where you will find this and much more information aout our activities.

Best,

Your HSF startup team
