We will use this newsletter to regularly post developments across HSF activity areas.

This newsletter is implemented using [github's Pages service](https://pages.github.com/) that makes it easy to create a website associated with a github account or project. [Pages uses Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/), a tool to automatically build a website from markup files (which are kept in github). It supports structured sites like blogs in a simple but powerful way.

Let's see if
