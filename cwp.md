# Community White Paper (CWP) 

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments 
over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of 
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that
the computing models will need to evolve and a significant "software 
upgrade" is required to prepare.
In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development 
investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The 
aim
is to produce a Community White Paper 
(CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for 
software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under
the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been 
specifically [charged by the WLCG project](/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) and
we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.

## Timeline

After the preparatory phase during Fall 2016, the CWP process will be launched at an [HSF workshop at SDSC/UCSD](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/) on January 23-27, 2017. The aim is to produce a consensus document by summer, 2017.

## Communication

To join the CWP process and get information about its progress, please join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group (no Google account is required, you can register by sending an email to [hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com)). Subscribing to this group with a Google account is required if you want to be able to contribute to CWP documents hosted in Google Docs.

## Working Groups

  During October, 2016, the process of forming CWP working groups has begun. We are letting the working groups self-organize with a bit of help from the HEP experiment software/computing coordinators and the HSF startup team. The first step for each working group is to formulate a charge to describe the challenges in that area and questions which need to be answered to produce a roadmap for the CWP. 

  The current working groups are:

The working group charges should be world-visible for reading. If you would
like to edit them, you will need to join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group and
login as your google user. If you would like organize an additional working group, please post to the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group.

## CWP Process

Additional information will be coming soon....

We maintain a [list of contributed CWP whitepapers](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html).


## Other notes

The timeline for producing a CWP by summer, 2017, corresponds roughly to
the plan for [CERN openlab](http://openlab.cern/) to produce a similar white paper describing the plans for their next phase beginning in January, 2018. We expect that the CWP process and CERN openlab planning processes will be synergistic.
