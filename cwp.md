# Community White Paper (CWP) - A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing

We have started the process for producing a Community White Paper (CWP) on software and computing to present the overall strategy and roadmap. 
This activity is organised under the umbrella of the HSF. After the preparatory phase during Fall 2016, the CWP process will be launched in January 2017 at UCSD (January 23-27). Several working groups covering various aspects of the computing challenges ahead of us will work together to produce a final document at the end of 2017.
