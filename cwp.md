# Community White Paper (CWP) 

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing in the 2020s

The HEP community faces a number of challenges for software and
computing over the next 10 years. To address these challenges we are
now beginning a process to produce a Community White Paper (CWP)
which will describe a consensus roadmap and strategy for software
and computing in HEP in the 2020s.  This activity is organised under
the umbrella of the HSF. After the preparatory phase during Fall
2016, the CWP process will be launched at an [HSF workshop at
SDSC/UCSD](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/) on January 23-27,
2017. The aim is to produce a consensus document by summer, 2017.

To join the CWP process and get information about its progress, please join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group (no Google account is required, you can register by sending an email to [hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com)). Subscribing to this group with a Google account is required if you want to be able to contribute to CWP documents hosted in Google Docs.

# CWP Working Groups

  During October, 2016, the process of forming CWP working groups has begun. We are letting the working groups self-organize with a bit of help from the HEP experiment software/computing coordinators and the HSF startup team. The first step for each working group is to formulate a charge to describe the challenges in that area and questions which need to be answered to produce a roadmap for the CWP. 

  The current working groups are:

The working group charges should be world-visible for reading. If you would
like to edit them, you will need to join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group and
login as your google user. If you would like organize an additional working group, please post to the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group.
