As promised in our last newsletter, we would like to update you on some more activities of the HSF.

In the last week we organized the first meeting of the *Common Track Reconstruction Software Forum*. Tracking software experts from the various experiments met to give a nice overview of the various software solutions that exist. If you are interested in all the details, the agenda and minutes can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/459865/).

Today's newsletter is however dedicated on two other activies - our HSF Logo Contest and the HSF Packaging Working Group.

## HSF Logo Contest

It is time the HSF had a logo! We hope for your ideas and creativity. Use the Christmas break and prepare a contribution. More details can be found [here](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/logo_contest.html).



## The HSF Packaging Working Group

One of the problems that has been solved too many times in our community is how collaborations can *build, package and distribute* their huge software stacks. In fact we aren't alone in re-doing this work over and over again. Many competing projects are around in the open-source community. But is this actually necessary?

To understand this in our field, a few volunteers gathered together and created the [**HSF Packaging Working Group**](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/packaging.html).

Up to now we met six times (see below) and had a look at the various existing implementations. The question was - do we have just spontaneous break of symmetry in our implementations or is there a reason for being different? We started collecting our findings in a little [report draft](https://github.com/HEP-SF/documents/tree/master/HSF-TN/draft-2015-PKG).

To make it short - rather soon it was clear that both requirements and solutions are pretty similar. There is obviously no silver bullet among the existing tools that makes every collaboration happy. We however found a way to increase the share of knowledge between the experiments' librarians. It is still a long way to make this actually happen, but we are motivated to.

Looking forward to your contributions and ideas!
