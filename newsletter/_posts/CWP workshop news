 +# Community White Paper (CWP) Workshop, San Diego,  23-26 January 2017 
 +
 +The HSF had its second workshop at LAL (Orsay, France) on May 2-4, 2016. It was well attended (70 people) representing many different laboratories, universities and institutions (~30) from both sides of the Atlantic, involved in different experiments (LHC, BELLE II, Intensity Frontier...). We were happy to see a lot of new faces! [Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/timetable/) was a mix of (lively!) general discussions and topical/hands-on sessions. Live notes of these discussions are [available](????). This newsletter summarizes them.
 +
 +One of the breaking news is that the HSF now has a logo! Thanks to J. Lingermann, the winner of the logo contest, and to all of you who took the time to submit a logo proposal.

 +## Projects and Project Support
 +
 +
 +
 +## Software Packaging
 +
 +It has been one of the topical discussions. Software build tools and packaging are a key piece of the software interoperability. As we cannot envision all the projects adopting the same tools, the effort has concentrated on a review of the existing tools and an attempt to identify the tool with the greater potential as the integrating layer. One tool from the HPC world, Spark, generated a lot of hype. Some people tried to experiment it in various contexts in the last months and the workshop has been the occasion of an in-depth discussion about Spark potential and limits and how to move forward.

 +
 +## Learning from Others
 +
 +We got three interesting presentations from projects with goals similar to the HSF, in other context:
 +* BioConductor: an open-source project portal associated with an ecosystem of tools for bioinformatics
 +* Ne
 +
 +## Machine Learning
 +
 +One of the topical session at the workshop, it was divided between presentations about ML activities going on in the community and 3 hour RAMP (Rapid Analysis Machine Learning Prototype) session. Many topics were covered, including:
 +Summary of OpenLab Workshop (industry)
 +
 +* Machine Learning Challenges (e.g. HiggsML)
 +* Deep Learning
 +* TMVA updates
 +* Common Tracking Software (ACTS)
 +
 +This activity is developing very quickly in the community and a few months ago an Interexperiment Machine Learning (IML) forum has been created. The IML forum is willing to coordinates its activity with the HSF and it has been agreed that it will be the HSF ML forum.

 +
 +### Community White Paper
 +
 +The HSF demonstrated some initial collaborative activities but to address the challenges ahead (e.g. HL-LHC) need more and dedicated resources. To convince funding agencies and get a chance to obtain these resources, some US collegues launched the idea of a Community White Paper that will contain a description of the challenges ahead of us with a roadmap to address them. The idea is to build for computing something similar to the P5 process for HEP experiments in the US. In fact, the LHCC committee (that reviews the LHC experiments computing and WLCG infrastructure) asked recently WLCG to prepare a HL-LHC computing TDR in a similar timeframe and both processes could benefit from each other.
 +
 +There was a consensus that this was a high priority activity for the coming year. The proposal is to hold a serie of HSF-branded workshops and come up with a Community White Paper and roadmap by mid-2017. We are currently discussing the possibility of kick-off meeting around CHEP (probably either colocated or end of October at CERN).
 +
 +### Software and Computing Journal
 +
 +Some german collegues, supported by Springer editor, launched the idea of creating a journal dedicated to Data Intensive Science Sofware and Computing. Currently, there is no such journal and this is difficult to publish articles related to the computing aspect of our science (this is suitable neither for physics journals nor for computer science journals). The goal is to have a refereed, abstracted and indexed journal that could acoomplish the following goals:
