# Community White Paper (CWP) Workshop, San Diego,  23-26 January 2017 

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments over the next 10 years will require the HEP community 
to address a number of challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve
and a significant “software upgrade” is also required. A community planning process has been launched in order to identify and  
prioritize the software R&D investments that will be required. The aim is to produce a Community White paper (CWP) that will describe the 
community strategy and a roadmap for software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. 
 
A workshop took place 23-26 January in order to lunch the process of delivering the CWP.  The workshop was organised by the HSF and 
took place at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC)

One of the breaking news is that the HSF now has a logo! Thanks to J. Lingermann, the winner of the logo contest, and to all of you who took the time to submit a logo proposal.
