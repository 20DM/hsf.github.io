# Community White Paper (CWP) Workshop, San Diego,  23-26 January 2017 

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments over the next 10 years will require the HEP community  to address a number of challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve and a significant “software upgrade” is also required. A community planning process has been launched in order to identify and   prioritize the software R&D investments that will be required. The aim is to produce a Community White paper (CWP) that will describe the  community strategy and a roadmap for software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. 
 
A workshop took place 23-26 January in order to launch the process of delivering the CWP. The workshop was organised by the HSF and  took place at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC). There were 118 registered particpnts representing a  wide range of labs and universities based in the USA and in Europe. In addition there were a number of people representing industrial  partners, such as Intel, Google and Altair. 

In his welcome address Peter Elmer (Princeton) reminded delegates of the plans and timeline for upgrading the LHC machine and experiments with the aim of running at 5-7 x nominal luminosity (HL-LHC). The HL-LHC will integrate 100 times the current data, with significantly increased data (pileup) and detector complexity. The resulting computing needs will outpace the expected improvements in computer performance (Moore's Law) by factors of between 3 and 30. Technology change will also make it challenging to exploit Moore’s Law without software evolution and in addition there are software sustainability challenges associated with the further development and maintenance of softwre that is altrady 15-20 years old. The CWP will identify and prioritise the software research and development investments required:
 * to achieve improvements in software efficiency, scalability and performance and to make use of the advances in CPU, storage and 
 network technologies
 * to enable new approaches to computing and software that could radically extend the physics reach of the detectors
 * to ensure the long term sustainability of the software through the lifetime of the HL-LHC
The HSF is engaging the HEP community to produce the CWP via a “community process”:
 * Initiated as an HL-LHC planning process
 * Aiming for a broader participation (LHC, neutrino program, Belle II, linear collider so far)
