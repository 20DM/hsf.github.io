## Community White Paper (CWP) Working Groups

  During October, 2016, the process of forming CWP working groups has begun. We are letting the working groups self-organize with a bit of help from the HEP experiment software/computing coordinators and the HSF startup team. The first step for each working group is to formulate a charge to describe the challenges in that area and questions which need to be answered to produce a roadmap for the CWP. 

  The working group charges should be world-visible for reading. If you would
like to edit them, you will need to join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group and
login as your google user. If you would like organize an additional working group, please post to the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group.
