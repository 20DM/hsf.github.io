title: Software Build, Packaging and Distribution

Dear all,

one of the problems that has been solved too many times in our community is how collaborations can *build, package and distribute* their huge software stacks. In fact we aren't alone in re-doing this work over and over again. Many competing projects are around in the open-source community. But is this actually necessary?

To understand this in our field, a few volunteers gathered together and created the **HSF Packaging Working Group**.

Up to now we met six times (see below) and had a look at the various existing implementations. The question was - do we have just spontaneous break of symmetry in our implementations or is there a reason for being different? We collected our findings in a little [report](_TODO_).

To make it short - rather soon it was clear that both requirements and solutions are pretty similar. There is obviously no silver bullet among the existing tools that makes every collaboration happy. We however found a way to increase the share of knowledge between the experiments' librarians. It is still a long way to make this actually happen, but we are motivated to.

If you want to know more, join the packaging mailing list:

Looking forward to your contributions and ideas!

Best,

  Your HSF startup team
