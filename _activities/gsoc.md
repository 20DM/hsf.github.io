# Google Summer of Code 2017

## Introduction

[Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations. CERN-SFT participates in GSoC since 2011. This year the program has been expanded to involve the wider high-energy physics community via the HEP Software Foundation.  

Students interested in participating in the GSoC can find project proposals [here](#Projects).

HSF GSoC Administrators: Sergei Gleyzer <a href="mailto:sergei@cern.ch">sergei@cern.ch</a> and Enric Tejedor Saavedra <a href="mailto:etejedor@cern.ch">etejedor@cern.ch</a>

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here](/gsoc/guideline.html).


## Projects

{:.table .table-hover  .table-striped}
| ![ROOT](/images/rootlogo.png){:width="100px"} | A modular scientific software framework. It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_ROOT.html)|
| ![TMVA](/images/tmva_logo.gif){:width="100px"} | TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit for multivariate classification and regression analysis. TMVA performs the training, testing and performance evaluation of a large variety of multivariate methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_TMVA.html)|
| ![CMS](/images/CMS-Color.gif){:width="100px"} | [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/) (Compact Muon Solenoid) is a high-energy physics experiment at the LHC. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_CMS.html)|
| ![SixTrack](/images/sixtrack_logo.png){:width="100px"} | [SixTrack](http://cern.ch/sixtrack) is a software for simulating and analysing the trajectory of high energy particles in accelerators. It has been used in the design and optimization of the LHC and is now being used to design the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade that will be installed in the next decade. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_SixTrack.html) |
| **SciKit-HEP** | The [Scikit-HEP project](http://scikit-hep.org/) is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with a Python package containing core and common tools. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_SciKit-HEP.html)|
| ![GeantV](/images/geantv_logo.png){:width="100px"} | The GeantV project aims at developing a high performance detector simulation system integrating fastand fullsimulation that  can  be  ported  on  different  computing  architectures,  including CPU accelerators. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_GeantV.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/geanttiny.gif" width="100" alt="Geant4"> | Geant (for GEometry ANd Tracking) is a platform for "the simulation of the passage of particles through matter," using Monte Carlo methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_Geant4.html)|
| ![GoHEP](/images/go-hep-logo.png){:width="100px"} | The GoHEP project aims at developing robust and concurrency friendly libraries for HEP, astrophysics and cosmology. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_GoHEP.html)|
| ![FALCON](/images/falcon_logo.png){:width="100px"} | Falcon is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments. [List of proposals](/gsoc/project_FALCON.html)|
