# Community White Paper (CWP) 

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments 
over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of 
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that
the computing models will need to evolve and a significant "software 
upgrade" is required to prepare.
In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development 
investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The 
aim
is to produce a Community White Paper 
(CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for 
software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been 
specifically [charged by the WLCG project](/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) and
we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.

## Timeline

After a preparatory phase during Fall 2016, the CWP process was launched at an [HSF workshop at SDSC/UCSD](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/) on January 23-27, 2017. The aim is to produce a consensus document by summer, 2017.

## Communication

To join the CWP process and get information about its progress, please join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group (no Google account is required, you can register by sending an email to [hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com)). Subscribing to this group with a Google account is required if you want to be able to contribute to CWP documents hosted in Google Docs.

## Working Groups

  During October, 2016, the process of forming CWP working groups has begun. We are letting the working groups self-organize with a bit of help from the HEP experiment software/computing coordinators and the HSF startup team. The first step for each working group is to formulate a charge to describe the challenges in that area and questions which need to be answered to produce a roadmap for the CWP. 

  The working group charges should be world-visible for reading. If you would
like to edit them, you will need to join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group and
login as your google user. If you would like organize an additional working group, please post to the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group.

**Note: it is possible to register to all the Google groups without a Google account. In this case, send an empty email (subject and contents ignored) to the group email, adding `+subscribe` after the group name. (e.g. hsf-cwp-software-development+subscribe@googlegroups.com).**

## CWP Process

The CWP process will involve a number of workshops between January and Summer 2017. As part of the process members of the community are encouraged to write white papers to describe their ideas on the various topics. White papers can be submitted by anyone: individuals, groups of individuals, experiments, institutions, etc.

We maintain a [list of contributed CWP whitepapers](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html).

If you have a white paper which you would like to contribute to the CWP process, please submit it (in pdf or link form, e.g. in the arXiv) to hsf-cwp-white-paper-submission@googlegroups.com and it will add be added to this list.

Some guidance and suggestions for WGs can be found here:

## Other notes

The timeline for producing a CWP by summer, 2017, corresponds roughly to
the plan for [CERN openlab](http://openlab.cern/) to produce a similar white paper describing the plans for their next phase beginning in January, 2018. We expect that the CWP process and CERN openlab planning processes will be synergistic.
