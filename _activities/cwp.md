# Community White Paper (CWP) 

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments 
over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of 
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that
the computing models will need to evolve and a significant "software 
upgrade" is required to prepare.
In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development 
investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The 
aim
is to produce a Community White Paper 
(CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for 
software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been 
specifically [charged by the WLCG project](/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) and
we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.

## Editorial Team

## Timeline

After a preparatory phase during Fall 2016, the CWP process was launched in January, 2017. The aim is to produce a consensus document by 1 Sep, 2017.

A series of workshops/events have taken place:

  * 23-27 Jan, 2017 - HSF CWP workshop at SDSC/UCSD
    * [Indico page](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/)
  * 9 Mar, 2017 - Software Triggers and Event Reconstruction WG meeting
    * A CWP session at the [Connecting The Dots workshop](https://ctdwit2017.lal.in2p3.fr)
    * [Indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/614111/)
  * 20-22 Mar, 2017 - IML Topical Machine Learning Workshop
    * *CERN*
    * The workshop includes a CWP session on Machine Learning
    * [Indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/595059)
  * 28-30 Mar, 2017 - CWP Visualization Workshop
    * *CERN (and Vidyo)*
    * [Indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/617054/)
  * 8-12 May, 2017 - DS@HEP 2017 (Data Science in High Energy Physics)
    * *FNAL*
    * [Indico page](https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=13497)
  * 22-24 May, 2017 - HEP Analysis Ecosystem Retreat
    * *Amsterdam*
    * [Indico page](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/)
    * [Workshop proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aAGCj_y9in_I-c9yYJ-XX3Qurf0PXH4tFoYmvuCY5tk/edit#heading=h.9h0v0hyue6zf)
  * 5-6 Jun, 2017 - CWP Event Processing Frameworks Workshop
    * *FNAL*
    * The workshop is just prior to the FNAL 50th Anniversary and User Meeting
    * [Indico page](https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=14186)
  * 26-30 Jun, 2017 - HEP Software Foundation Workshop
    * *LAPP (Annecy)*
    * [Indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/613093/)

In the Annecy HSF workshop, the endgame timeline was discussed for the CWP.
Each of the CWP WGs is finalizing a dedicated WG white paper by the end
of July, 2017. From these shorter summaries are being extracted to produce 
the single, final Community White Paper document and roadmap by 1 Sep, 2017.

## Working Groups


  The list of CWP working groups, their charges and status is maintained on a [dedicated working group page](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html).

## Communication

To join the CWP process and get information about its progress, please join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group (no Google account is required, you can register by sending an email to [hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com)). Subscribing to this group with a Google account is required if you want to be able to contribute to CWP documents hosted in Google Docs. Individual working groups may also have their own list or google group (see below).

## CWP Process

The CWP process has involved a number of workshops between January and Summer 2017. As part of the process members of the community have been encouraged to write white papers to describe their ideas on the various topics. White papers can be submitted by anyone: individuals, groups of individuals, experiments, institutions, etc.

We maintain a [list of contributed CWP whitepapers](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html).

If you have a white paper which you would like to contribute to the CWP process, please submit it (in pdf or link form, e.g. in the arXiv) to hsf-cwp-white-paper-submission@googlegroups.com and it will add be added to this list.

Some guidance and suggestions for WGs can be found here:

## Other notes

The timeline for producing a CWP by summer, 2017, corresponds roughly to
the plan for [CERN openlab](http://openlab.cern/) to produce a similar white paper describing the plans for their next phase beginning in January, 2018. We expect that the CWP process and CERN openlab planning processes will be synergistic.
