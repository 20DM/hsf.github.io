# Logo contest

It's time the HSF had a logo, so we're holding a contest. Put your creativity to work and send your proposals to the [HSF startup team](hep-sf-startup-team@googlegroups.com). We will add the proposals to [http://it.wikitolearn.org/Main_HSF_Page/Some_proposals_for_the_HSF_logo](http://it.wikitolearn.org/Main_HSF_Page/Some_proposals_for_the_HSF_logo), so that everybody can see your ideas. The deadline is Janurary 10th 2016. So you have the entire Christmas break for forming ideas and preparing contributions.  

After the deadline there will be a community-wide vote on selecting the best logo.

## Our wish list

Apart from your idea for the greatly looking logo, there are a few technical conditions to make a contribution useful for the community:

  * the logo has to be in a scalable, non-raster, vectorform (PDF/SVG/EPS),
  * the logo should work both in coloured and monochrome representations,
  * we would need versions of it in different aspect ratios allowing different usages (like top-banners, side-banners, etc),
  * nice-to-have - but not a requirement - is making the original file you used for creation of the logo available.

Finally, we would like to put - at least a variant of - the logo under a free license, so that other projects can use it to denote a connection with the HSF. Similar to the concept of the *open use logo* of the Debian project.

Looking forward to your ideas!
