# Discussion Forums

Discussions and activities in the HEP Software Foundation rely on several mailing lists and forums, some of them for general discussions, others for topical ones. All these forums are open to anybody interested and archives are publically available but they generally require that you register in order to participate.


## General Discussion Forums

### General Information about HSF: hep-sf-forum

The [hep-sf-forum](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/hep-sf-forum) is the general announcement and discussion forum for the HSF. Our meeting announcements are posted here, as are meeting minutes, including minutes of the startup team meetings. The forum is intended for discussion, not just announcements. And everybody interested into the HSF, even though it is only for specific topic, is encourage to register to this forum to get all announcements. 

### HSF Technical Forum: hep-sf-tech-forum

The [hep-sf-tech-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/hep-sf-tech-forum) is the general open forum for technical discussions on HEP Software Foundation topics. Anyone subscribing here should be prepared for technical emails, so posters should not be shy about posting technical issues! Topics can be forked off to dedicated forums as appropriate.


### HEP S&C community mailing list

This is not strictly an HSF mailing list. The [HEP S&C community mailing list](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/hep-sw-comp) is intended for occasional HEP software and computing community mailings. Everyone involved or interested in HEP S&C is encouraged to sign up to this list. It will be used for occasional mailings of community wide interest, such as announcements of HEP S&C conferences, workshops and schools not strictly related to the HSF.


## Topical Forums

Some of these forums are pre-existing the HSF or have not been initiated directly by the HSF but are strongly related to the HSF activities and run in coordination with it.
