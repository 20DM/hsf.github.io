# The HSF timeline

## Organization

The initial organization of the HSF was established at the [Sep 2014 meeting of
the Interim Foundation Board (IFB)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/hsf-ifb-4th-meeting).
At that meeting a startup plan was proposed and accepted, with a startup team
constituted to guide the establishment of the HSF. A priority for the
organization is to support both focused efforts and broad inclusiveness. We aim
to achieve both by engaging the broad community as well as core volunteers.
Core efforts can be supplemented and expanded by seeding and encouraging broad
involvement such that community engagement amplifies the effort.

## Summary timeline and milestones

 * Jan 2014: [HEP Software Collaboration Proposed](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/sites/default/files/Open_Scientific_Software_Collaboration.pdf)
 * Apr 2014: [HEP Software Collaboration meeting](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/hep-software-collaboration-meeting-apr-2014)
 * Spring/Summer 2014: gathering White Papers from the community.
 * Oct 1 2014: [Startup plan approved and startup team established](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/hsf-ifb-4th-meeting).
Agreement on the HEP science communities and software domains to focus on
initially. Subsequently the website, google groups, and knowledge base were
initiated, and the first priority of synthesizing the white papers was begun.
 * Nov 11 2014: [White Paper Analysis and Proposed Startup Plan](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/sites/default/files/HSFwhitepaperanalysisandstartupplanV1.1.pdf) released,
followed by discussions and contact meetings with many parts of the community
prior to the SLAC workshop.
 * Jan 20-22 2015: [SLAC HSF workshop](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/hep-software-foundation-workshop-slac-jan-20-21-2015) established concrete activities (see this website) and next steps for the HSF.
 * Mar 3 2015: Working groups, services, activities emerging from the workshop established.
 * Apr 17, 2015: [HSF meeting at CHEP 2015, Okinawa](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/hsf-meeting-chep-2015-fri-apr-17-2015)
to present progress, assess opportunities emerging from CHEP, and discuss next steps.

## White Paper Analysis and Proposed Startup Plan

The startup team produced a document analyzing the white papers (below) and
proposing a startup plan. A [version 1.0 draft](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/sites/default/files/HSFwhitepaperanalysisandstartupplanV1.0.pdf)
was released on Nov 11 2014. An updated [version 1.1](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/sites/default/files/HSFwhitepaperanalysisandstartupplanV1.1.pdf)
was released on Jan 7 2015. Both revisions are attached to this page.

## White papers

As an initial step towards creating the HSF, in spring 2014 the HEP software and computing community was asked to submit short white papers conveying ideas as to how the HSF should be constituted and how it could be useful. The white papers received are attached to this page:
