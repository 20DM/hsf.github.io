## May HSF workshop program

- [Workshop page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/)
- [Timetable](https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/timetable/#all.detailed)
- [doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/8hpxredhnci2i8xh)

Registered participant count is 30 (up from 20 two weeks ago).

**Monday morning**

What we said last time:

"We will invite volunteers to bring guinea pig projects to an HSF project incubator/template hackathon on Monday morning, coordinated by Benedikt with the assistance of Pere. If there is a critical mass of takers, we will hold it; if not, we won't. We need to produce a sufficiently clear and detailed description of what it will involve to attract the sort of people who should be interested."

Any invitation gone out? Who is driving this?

**Opening session - Mon afternoon**

Review the specific slate of identified speakers... all now in indico?

What we added at least tentatively last time were...

- Tutorial-oriented presentations of WikiToLearn (Riccardo) -- should also cover Jupyter etc -- and the knowledge base (Torre) aimed at giving people sufficient information and ideas for them to try adding materials on their own during the workshop, with designated slots later in the workshop (Wed lunch?, coffee breaks?) to offer help and take questions.
- Project incubator/template status, also reporting on the Mon am incubator session preceding

As we said last time, trying out Jupyter/ROOT requires CERN login, should inform people in advance how to get a basic CERN account... happening?

**Machine learning - Tue 9am**

Organizers: David Rousseau, Jean-Roch Vlimant

Other people (Fermilab?) in the loop to help organize?

The session has a filled in agenda, thank you David et al!

As we said last time, a RAMP hackathon, a second half-day (Tue afternoon), may be a possibility. Will we have this? What will be the specific topic? Should we poll attendees for interest?

**Packaging - Tue 2pm**

Organizers: Liz Sexton-Kennedy, Benedikt Hegner (or designees)

Status of organizing this session?

**Geant4 technical forum - Tue 4pm**

Organizer: Makoto Asai.

Reported by Makoto:
"Our technical forum at Orsay will be 90 minutes, 45 minutes of introductory presentations by Geant4 developers on recent new features and near future deliverables, followed by 45 minutes of users' presentations on their status/issues/requirements. 
This technical forum meeting is of course open to anybody including HSF members who have nothing to do with Geant4, to see as a model case how a software project would interact with its user community.
We expect user participation would not be limited to HEP but also from nuclear physics, space and medical applications, material science, and if we are lucky from security."

Hopefully Makoto or designee can attend to discuss more specifics. Including...

The suggestion from the discussion last time: follow up on what was discussed at SLAC that it would be useful to have a configurable software stack that Geant4 can use with its releases to avoid (at least for HEP-targeted releases) baking into the release particular sw versions.

**Software concurrency and performance - Wed 9am**

Organizers: Vincenzo Innocente, Paolo Calafiura, Markus Schulz

Paolo and Markus have joined Vincenzo in organizing this session. Thanks! They will send a mail to hep-sf-forum regarding plans for the session. Hopefully at least one of them can attend to discuss.


Recall the [agreed proposal for this session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IwY3EiTuCkUI_YXcq7-N265MzA-5iJpl87bR22vfmk0/edit?usp=sharing).


**Closing session - Wed 2pm**

Any developments to the sketched out agenda:

- Accommodate any need for extra time accrued during the workshop
- No topic summaries, we have no parallel sessions
- Conclusions, outcomes, next steps
- Follow-on workshop plans: concurrency/performance, ...
- Objectives for an HSF meeting at CHEP
